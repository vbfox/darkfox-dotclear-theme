A dark and very simple theme for my blog.

It should :

* Be beautiful in my personal opinion.
* Be the simplest possible, no pictures, no comments, no calendar, widgets, search, ...
* Use CSS3 and stay readable when not available.
* Shouldn't try to emulate the look on old browsers, readable is enough, good looking is for up-to-date clients.
* Not require javascript.
* Adapt to most screen resolutions (from phones to 30" screens)
